# Venv

This git repo is my working linux working environemet setup. The following prepare my `.vimrc` and my `.bashrc`.
Note that I've been inspired by other vimrc files around the web but alswo have a custom vimrc that aim for my daily use. You will notice emmet, golang ... which could be not important for someone else. Also I'm still using bundle which can be old for some new users but still works fine for me.

### Note

It is important to know that I am compiling my own vim with python3+ support. You can follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source) which is very clear than any TLDR I can write.
